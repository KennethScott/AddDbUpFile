## 1.0
**2016-04-17**

- [x] Shamelessly gutted and tweaked the awesome AddAnyFile extension from Mads into AddDbUpFile to work specifically with DbUp sql scripts.  Extension 
now automatically forces a date/time stamp on the front of the script filenames and gives an option to mark as an embedded resource.
